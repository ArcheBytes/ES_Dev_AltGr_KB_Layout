# US AltGr ES (Windows)

Custom **Windows-only** keyboard layout based on the **US layout**, designed for developers who write in Spanish but want a clean, programming-friendly keyboard.

This layout keeps the standard US behavior (no dead keys) and adds Spanish characters using **AltGr**.

## Features

- Base layout: **US**
- **No dead keys**
- Instant characters (no composition, no delays)
- Programming-friendly (`'`, `"`, `{}`, `[]`, etc. behave normally)
- Spanish characters via **AltGr**:
  - `AltGr + a` → á
  - `AltGr + e` → é
  - `AltGr + i` → í
  - `AltGr + o` → ó
  - `AltGr + u` → ú
  - `AltGr + n` → ñ
  - `AltGr + Shift` → uppercase variants
  - Diéresis support (ü / Ü) using a dedicated combination:
  - `Ctrl + Alt + ' `then `u` → ü
  - `Ctrl + Alt + ' `then `Shift + u` → Ü

## Why this layout

Standard Windows layouts with international support rely on dead keys, which can be disruptive when programming.  
This layout avoids dead keys entirely while still providing fast access to Spanish characters.

## Installation

1. Download the installer from the **Releases** section.
2. Run `setup.exe`.
3. Log out or reboot.
4. Enable the layout in:
   - **Settings → Time & Language → Language & Region → Keyboards**

## Notes

- This layout is **Windows-only**.
- Designed to be used with a standard US physical keyboard.
- Works especially well with custom keyboards and firmware (e.g. AltGr on hold).
